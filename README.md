" Ryff was conceived at LA Hacks 2014 by Chris Laganiere and Robert Fotino, two first-year computer science students at UCLA.

Ryff is an app to help musicians find each other. You can create an artist profile, add your musical interests, and connect with other local musicians looking to play. Ryff allows you to record and post samples of your music without leaving the app, so you can show off your talents to people in the area. Do your friends have a band, but nobody wants to play drums? Start a group on Ryff and search for nearby artists who play drums. Trying to find a guitarist who's into a specific genre? You can do that, too.

Ryff allows you to connect with the people that you want to be connected with. You can browse nearby artists and musical groups with similar tastes, hear how they sound, and either add them to your favorites or skip them and move on to the next. If you like the music of a particular artist, you should message them and meet up. Here at Ryff it's our belief that you should Never Jam Alone.

If you have an iPhone, Ryff is coming soon to an app store near you. Android and web interfaces are in the works. If you have any questions or feedback, you can email the creators at robert.fotino@gmail.com and chrislaganiere@gmail.com. "
